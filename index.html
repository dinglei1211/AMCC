                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>Cutting parameters and tool wear both have significant influence on energy consumption in the processing. In a multi-feature parts batch processing, tool wear values are continuously increasing with the proceeding of processing, leading to a higher energy consumption. To reduce the wear speed, cutting parameters should be continuously adjusted according to different states of tool wear during batch processing. However, current cutting parameter optimization studies only focus on one specific workpiece and the tool wear is seldom considered in the batch processing. To fill this research gap, a cutting parameter energy-saving optimization method considering tool wear for multi-feature parts batch processing was proposed in this paper. First, the synergistic effect mechanism of cutting parameters and tool wear on energy consumption in the batch processing was analyzed. On this basis, a multi-objective cutting parameter optimization model for multi-feature parts batch processing was established. Then, the multi-objective cuckoo search (MOCS) algorithm was used to solve the optimization model. Finally, an experimental case was carried out to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method. Results show that energy consumption and machining time can be, respectively, decreased by 22.9% and 4.1%. Meanwhile, a conflict relationship exists between the energy consumption and machining time in the processing and the trade-off of them is analyzed in this paper.</p>

                            <p class="speaker">Hao Li</p>

                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>Spatter is an inherent, unpreventable, and undesired phenomenon in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing. Spatter behavior has an intrinsic correlation with the forming quality in L-PBF because it leads to metallurgical defects and the degradation of mechanical properties. This impact becomes more severe in the fabrication of large-sized parts during the multi-laser L-PBF process. Therefore, investigations of spatter generation and countermeasures have become more urgent. This work explores the literature on the in-situ detection, generation, effects, and countermeasures of spatter in L-PBF. It is expected to pave the way towards a novel generation of highly efficient and intelligent L-PBF systems.</p>

                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>With the development of laser 3D printing technology, it has become easier to process NiTi alloys into components with complex geometrical structures and customized phase transformation temperatures. However, unlike traditional processes, laser 3D printing involves directly fabricating components from powder materials, which not only includes shaping but also metallurgical processes, meaning that functionality adjustments also lead to changes in microstructure. As a result, the practical application of laser-printed NiTi alloys has not been widely reported. This review summarizes our recent work on NiTi SMAs using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology, aiming to demonstrate how laser processes can be utilized to customize the functionalities of NiTi alloys. The content also includes the problems we encountered during the adjustment process and our understanding of the solutions. This work contributes to advancing the practical application of laser-printed NiTi alloys.</p>

                            <p class="speaker">Jianfeng Zeng</p>
                            <div class="abstract">
                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>A novel dual-motor coupling powertrain (DMCP) with speed and torque coupling is proposed. In this powertrain, a planetary gear unit couples the speed of two motors, and another shaft-fixed gear unit couples the torque of two motors. By means of integrated control the electric motors, synchronizer, and clutches, the DMCP can operate in four modes to satisfy the demands of different running conditions, thereby improving the energy utilization efficiency. In this paper, the operating principles of the DMCP in various modes are analyzed, and the instantaneous overall efficiency is optimized based on the vehicle longitudinal kinetic theory. Besides, this paper formulates the optimal mode shift strategy and power split strategy of the DMCP, and a detailed dual-motor EV model is developed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation result indicates that, compared with the normal single motor two-speed powertrain, the DMCP can effectively improve the energy utilization efficiency of the EV and extends the EV's driving range.</p>

                                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                                <p>Sudden changes in curvature and uneven allowance distribution make it challenging to determine and control the target contact force. The determination of target contact force is closely related to the establishment of an accurate contact force model, as the precision of this model directly impacts the machining accuracy of the blade. Contact force control is typically achieved through a controller; however, complex controllers can lead to prolonged response times, resulting in over-grinding or under-grinding. This presentation primarily focuses on the determination and control of grinding contact force in robotic belt grinding. It begins with an analysis of how to establish an accurate grinding contact force model to derive the target contact force, then moves to the design of a controller to achieve stable control of this target force. The core of this presentation is the use of contact force control methods to enhance the machining accuracy of aero-engine blades.</p>

                                <p>Crafting an effective energy management strategy is crucial for enhancing the robustness and economic viability of these vehicles. Therefore, an energy management strategy (EMS) for FCHEVs was proposed based on model predictive control (MPC) with a variable time domain. This approach integrated driving pattern recognition and model predictive control to overcome the robustness challenges faced by conventional EMS. Variational modal decomposition (VMD) was integrated with a radial basis function neural network for velocity predictions across various frequencies, which mitigated the effect of prediction accuracy on vehicles' energy efficiency. Additionally, driving pattern recognition (DPR) was used to determine the driving condition online, which enhanced the influence of prediction duration on energy efficiency. This system adapted the prediction duration to the current driving condition to optimize hydrogen consumption.</p>
